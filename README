This program allows you to stop applications from using OSS4 so it can be restarted (e.g. after a buggy behaviour or for a suspend).

Usage:
	$ make
	$ ./proxyoss -d -n loldsp
	make your software use /dev/loldsp as the audio device
	make your suspend/resume scripts send SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 signal to proxyoss and wait a bit before shutting down/after getting up OSS

This thing is essentially a kludge, lacks the most of ioctl's support and haven't got through any sensible testing, so it may fail to work for you. Though the proccess of adding a new ioctl is simple.

Works fine with:
	mplayer
	SDL
	Skype
	Adobe Flash
	mumble
